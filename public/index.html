            <ol>
                <li>We became proto-cyborgs, with most of humanity having a computer at the tip of their fingers...</li>
                <li>We passed the Turing test without even noticing...</li>
                <li>AI is rapidly evolving nearing singularity...</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                We believe in a near future where AI and the Human Collective will work together in harmony.
            </p>

            <p>
                It's up to us to create the future we believe in.
